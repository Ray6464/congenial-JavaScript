# congenial-JavaScript
This is a Repo containing .vimrc code and supplimenting files to allow Vim users to write JavaScript code the way I do, using boilerplate code with intuituve key-bindings to avoide pain while typing.

1. The .vimrc file has code we can add to our .vimrc file.  
2. The files in ".vim" needs to be copied to your "~/.vim" direcory.  
3. When installed properly this will enable certain Normal-mode and Insert-mode commands keybindings for Vim that makes writing JavaScript code easier.
4. Useful Input and Critisim is welcome.
5. If you contribute make sure to put your name and email in the contributers.md file.

## Following Commands are present for JavaScript in Normal-mode
1. `,fun` for Functions.
2. `,funcon` for Functions with a console.log.
3. `,for` for For loop.
4. `,si` for SetInterval.
5. `,con` for console.log.

## Following Commands are present for JavaScript in Insert-mode
1. `Ctrl+z` + `fun` for Functions.
2. `Ctrl+z` + `funcon` for Functions with a console.log.
3. `Ctrl+z` + `for` for For loop.
4. `Ctrl+z` + `si` for SetInterval.
5. `Ctrl+z` + `con` for console.log.
